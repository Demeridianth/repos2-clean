# SIMPLE

An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu in a restaurant 🍽️:

The menu (API) tells you what dishes (functions/features) you can order.

The kitchen (code/system) makes the food, but you don’t need to know how.

You just place an order through the menu (API request) and get back a result (API response).

👉 In short: An API is a way for different programs to talk to each other.

Want me to also explain the difference between a web API (like FastAPI) and a library API (like Python’s os module)?


# EXAMPLES

Everyday Examples of APIs at work 🚀


Google Maps in an App

You order food from a delivery app 🍕.

The app shows you a live map with the courier’s location.

The app itself doesn’t have maps built in — it calls Google Maps API to fetch directions, distances, and coordinates.


Weather Apps

Your phone’s weather app 🌤️ doesn’t measure weather.

It asks a Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) for current conditions, forecasts, etc.

The app just displays the API’s data.


PayPal / Stripe Payments

You buy something online 🛒.

The store’s website doesn’t process your card directly — instead, it calls the PayPal or Stripe API to handle secure payment.


Login with Google/Facebook

You log into a site using your Google account.

That site uses Google’s OAuth API to confirm your identity and send back basic info (like your email).
